        The Solution Explorer asks simple questions about your dispute. It’s free, anonymous, and confidential.
        
        The Solution Explorer doesn't provide legal advice. But it gives you legal information based on your answers. It even has template letters that you can send someone to try and resolve a dispute on your own.
        
        It also classifies your dispute and gives you the right CRT online application form for your situation.
        
        
        <b>How to make a CRT claim</b>
        
        To apply, choose “Make a claim with the CRT” when asked what you like to do about your issue, and follow the prompts. There's no obligation to make a CRT claim. You can use the Solution Explorer any time for free legal information and tools.
