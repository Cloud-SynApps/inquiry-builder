                <h3><strong>General Provisions</strong></h3>
           
               <p> For the purpose of this Agreement, import licensing is defined as administrative
                procedures1 used for the operation of import licensing regimes requiring the submission of
                an application or other documentation (other than that required for customs purposes) to
                the relevant administrative body as a prior condition for importation into the customs
                territory of the importing Member.</p>
                (footnote original)<p><b>1</b> Those procedures referred to as "licensing" as well as other similar
                administrative procedures.</p><p><b>2</b>. Members shall ensure that the administrative procedures used to implement import
                licensing regimes are in conformity with the relevant provisions of GATT 1994 including its
                annexes and protocols, as interpreted by this Agreement, with a view to preventing trade
                distortions that may arise from an inappropriate operation of those procedures, taking into
                account the economic development purposes and financial and trade needs of developing
                country Members.2
                (footnote original)
                2 Nothing in this Agreement shall be taken as implying that the basis,
                scope or duration of a measure being implemented by a licensing procedure is subject to
                question under this Agreement.</p><p><b>3</b>. The rules for import licensing procedures shall be neutral in application and
                administered in a fair and equitable manner.</p><p> <b>4</b>. (a) The rules and all information concerning procedures for the submission of
                applications, including the eligibility of persons, firms and institutions to make such
                applications, the administrative body(ies) to be approached, and the lists of products subject
                to the licensing requirement shall be published, in the sources notified to the Committee on
                Import Licensing provided for in Article 4 (referred to in this Agreement as "the
                Committee"), in such a manner as to enable governments3 and traders to become
                acquainted with them. Such publication shall take place, whenever practicable, 21 days prior
                to the effective date of the requirement but in all events not later than such effective date.
                Any exception, derogations or changes in or from the rules concerning licensing procedures
                or the list of products subject to import licensing shall also be published in the same manner
                and within the same time periods as specified above. Copies of these publications shall also
